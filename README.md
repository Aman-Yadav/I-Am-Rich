# I-Am-Rich
Flutter application which makes you feel rich ;)
When the iPhone 3g was released and mobile app development was still in infancy an ios developer made an app called "I Am Rich"
which did absolutely nothing and was priced at $999.99 . It just showed a picture of a ruby so here's my version of that app.
